create an android app that shows the time
As an AI language model, I'm unable to create an android app, but I can give you some guidelines on how you can create an android app that shows the time. Here are the basic steps to create an android app that shows the time:

Install and set up the Android Studio development environment.
Create a new Android project.
In the layout file, add a TextView widget to display the time.
In the Java code, use the java.time package to get the current time.
Update the TextView widget with the current time.
Add a timer to refresh the TextView widget at regular intervals, so it displays the updated time.
Here is an example of the Java code to get the current time and update the TextView widget:

java
Copy code
TextView timeTextView = findViewById(R.id.timeTextView);
LocalTime currentTime = LocalTime.now();
timeTextView.setText(currentTime.toString());
You can also add additional features to the app, such as changing the time format or adding a clock widget. Once you have finished coding your app, you can test it on an Android emulator or a physical device, and then publish it on the Google Play Store.
